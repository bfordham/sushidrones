# SushiDrones

This is the code that drives [drones.socialistsushi.com](http://drones.socialistsushi.com)

All this started out as an API for [Dronestre.am API](http://dronestre.am/). It's grown a bit from there, and now maps out the drone strikes documented by Dronestre.am.

This is also a project I'm using to play with some things I haven't had much chance to mess with before. Specifically, Sinatra, MongoDB, and Heroku.
