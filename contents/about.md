## About

### Why

Since the US started drone strikes it has distrubed me on a couple of levels. First, that we had begun killing people with no due process. Second, it has bothered me that not too many people seem to notice.

SushiDrones is my attempt to make the results of this more visible. Yes, it's a small thing considering the problem.

### How

SushiDrones would not be possible without the data from [Dronestre.am](http://www.dronestre.am), which [Josh Begley](http://joshbegley.com/) graciously allows me to use for this project.
